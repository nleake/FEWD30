COLOR SWITCHER CODE ALONG
IDs and classes are particular in JS;

You can console.log the style of an object to check out what styles are applied to it.
If there are conflicting IDs further down in your document, JS isn't going to care about those and ignore them.

Went over events, pseudo code, and getElementById.

getElementById selects the element by ID.

jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.

Converting numbers to strings
var number = 4;
number.toString(); => "4"
number + ""; => "4" //string interpolation with the /"+/"

Submitting a form will usually refresh the page. Returning false will break it beforehand.

Turn in the temperature converterDo
Do the assignment in the latest folders and stuff

FEWD30 Day 12 - 

function createLi(myLiText){
  $('#container>ol').prepend("<li>"+ myLiText +"</li>");

Use multiline arrays and lists
var groceries=[
  "milk",
  "cookies",
  "sugar",
  "bananas"
];
groceries.forEach(CreateLi)

$("#container, #main").css("width", "960px");


Using "this" with jQuery - it targets the selected thing

	$("p").on("click", function(e){
	  $(this).fadeOut(500);
	})
